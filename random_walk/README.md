# Random Walk Visualisation (Plotly Express)

This script generates a random walk using Python and visualizes it using Plotly Express.

It's based on an exercise from *Python Crash Course* and helped me practice:

- Working with randomness and loops
- Creating and styling plots with Plotly
- Writing functions and conditionals

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have `plotly` installed:
```bash
pip install plotly
```

2. Then run the script:
```bash
python random_walk_plotly.py
```

3. An interactive plot will open in your browser showing a random walk.
